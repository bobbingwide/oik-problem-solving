Custom Post Types for Problem Solving


## Description 
In the Problem Solving presentation each Step can represent one or more questions.
We reverse engineer any Question that may be asked to one of these steps.
Then we're supposed to write a sensible response to the question.

Problems are examples where we can identify the Step or Steps which were applicable to the problem's resolution

Both Questions and Problems can refer to multiple Steps, which are implemented as the oik_presentation CPT
delivered by the oik-presentation plugin.
